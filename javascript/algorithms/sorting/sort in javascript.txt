sort in javascript 

sort of array in javascript is compare the unicode of the string
if its integer, its going to convert integer to string, and check the unicode of the first string
exp :

68 -> unicode of 6 is 54
74 -> unicode of 7 is 55
34 -> unicode of 3 is 51

its gonna be problem if you sort that have integer 68 with 7, 7 is always gonna be greater than 68

to sort properly

arr.sort(function (a,b){
    return a-b
})
