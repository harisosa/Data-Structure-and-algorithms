rules
1. can only have 0,1,2 child nodes
2. each child can only have one parent


level 0 : 2^0 = 1;
level 1 : 2^1 = 2;
level 2 : 2^2 = 4;
level 3 : 2^3 = 8;

# of nodes = 2^h -1; (tree formula to find out how much the nodes)
log nodes = steps

log 100 = 2
10^2 = 100

bany tree is O(log n) time complexity
